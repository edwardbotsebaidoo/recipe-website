                <li>Heavy cream</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>

            </ul>
        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cook Pasta:</strong> Cook fettuccine pasta according to package instructions. Drain and set aside, reserving some pasta water.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare Chicken:</strong> Season chicken breasts or tenderloins with salt and pepper. Cook them in a skillet over medium-high heat until fully cooked and golden brown on both sides. Remove from skillet and let them rest before slicing or chopping into bite-sized pieces.</li>
            <li><strong>Make Alfredo Sauce:</strong> In the same skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in heavy cream and bring to a simmer. Gradually stir in grated Parmesan cheese until the sauce is smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine Ingredients:</strong> Add the cooked pasta and chicken pieces to the skillet with the alfredo sauce. Gently toss everything together until the pasta and chicken are evenly coated with the sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of reserved pasta water to reach your desired consistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Once everything is heated through and well combined, serve the chicken alfredo hot. Optionally, garnish with additional grated Parmesan cheese and freshly ground black pepper. Enjoy your delicious homemade chicken alfredo.</li>
